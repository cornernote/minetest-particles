Description
----------------------------------

Creates 3D textured particles after digging nodes. 

The particles scatter in random directions and bounce a little when they hit the ground.


----------------------------------
Modders Guide
----------------------------------

Dig Particles:

Add this line to your mod:

particles.register_dig_particle(node,texture,[params])
- node = the name of the node (your_mod:your_node)
- texture = a png file without the .png extension
- params = (optional) additional params that will be added to the entity table

EG:
create particles of wood after digging a bookshelf:
particles.register_dig_particle("default:bookshelf","default_wood")


Smoke Particles and Signal Bubbles:

Add smokes=1 or signalbubbles=1 to the groups in the node definition.

EG:
minetest.register_node("your_mod:your_item", {
	description = "Your Item",
	groups = {smokes=1},
})
